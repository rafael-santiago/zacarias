1. Latest releases are on the top.
2. The versions are cumulative, any feature drop is informed.
3. Usually, I try to do my best in order to bring you 'RELNOTES' instead of notes from hell ;)

    First formalization of what I have been using along the last months.

    Features:

        - Profile attachment/detachment.
        - Password addition, deletion and getting.
        - Sessioned profiles.
        - Some anti-debugging mitigations.
        - Some password leaking countermeasures:
            * Static linking by default.
            * Libc hooking avoidance for more critical parts (for people that still prefers shared linking).
            * Password database edition done only from kernel-side.
            * Sessioned profiles.
        - Encryption/authentication scheme: AES-256/GCM
        - KDF: Argon2i
        - Device drivers signature not supported but some signing infrastructure/conveniences are offered
          by the build.
        - Installing/Uninstalling conveniences offered by the build.
