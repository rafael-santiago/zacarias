x (A) Allow password typing on when X server is down too. +Dev,+User,+Improvement
x (B) Add copyring disclaimer and license. +Dev,+Documentation
x (A) Add to system tests case when session passwords are used (on password command: add, del, get sub-commands). +Test
x (A) Fix Argon2 heap corruption. +Dev,+Sys,+BugHunting,+Improvement
x (A) Stop using static libkryptos inside 'dev'. Write a build task that copies it at the first time or
      when explicitly asked for. +Dev,+Sys,+Build,+Improvement
x (A) Find a way of running main core tests inside 'test' directory. +Dev,+Sys,+User,+Tests,+Build

x (A) Have the possibility of static linking xorg dependencies thus chances of library hooking will be mitigated much more.
      Xorg must be compiled and hosted into repo's lib/Xorg directory.
      User should indicate the proper packages of libX11, libXau, libXdmcp, libXext, libXtst and libxcb,
      the build must unpack those tarballs, compile and finally extract the relevant artifacts into lib/Xorg. +Dev,+Build,+Sec
