# Zacarias - user's guide

``Zacarias`` is a password manager with ``kernel-mode`` powers. It is suitable for freak paranoid users that do not like
the idea of having a simple user application encrypting/decrypting your passwords sit on ``user-space`` sending their
passwords to clipboard. A simple user application that can be accessible from other applications or even easily debugged,
probed, logged, hooked, swapped out from memory etc.
