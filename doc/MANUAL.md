# Zacarias - user's guide

``Zacarias`` is a password manager with ``kernel-mode`` powers. It is suitable for freak paranoid users that do not like
the idea of having a simple user application encrypting/decrypting your passwords sit on ``user-space`` sending their
passwords to clipboard. A simple user application that can be accessible from other applications or even easily debugged,
probed, logged, hooked, swapped out from memory etc. You prefer mitigating those issues by letting ``kernel`` takes the control
during some critical parts of your passwords management.

As you may know the name ``Zacarias`` means ``the Lord recalled``. ``Lord`` here relates to the ``kernel`` of your operating
system. Only it will access directly your password database, never ever the ``user-space`` portion. In this sense if we got
a leak, this leak will be less harmful.
